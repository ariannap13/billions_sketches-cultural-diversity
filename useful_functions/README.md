This folder contains a series of useful code snippets:

* ``plot_drawings_examples.py``: this is the code that can be used to plot examples of sketches classified within each cluster.
* ``plot_drawings_conn_components.py``: similar to above but for non-clusterable categories.
* ``save_emb_metadata.py``: allows to save embeddings and related metadata in separate files for each category.
* ``plot_umap_clusters.py``allows to plot umap representation of categories colored by clusters.
